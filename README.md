TOML - MIRI (FIB-UPC) \
April 2022

Code:
- [P0.py](./P0.py). Plots of the Energy and Delay functions, and the Energy-Delay curve. 
- [P1_gpkit.py](./P1_gpkit.py). Minimization of the Energy consumption and end-to-end Delay using the `gpkit` package 
and plots.
- [P2.py](./P2.py). Optimization with the Nash Bargaining Scheme and plot for different Lmax.
